Next.js: The presence of /_next/static/ paths in the <link> and <script> tags, along with the NEXT-ROUTE-ANNOUNCER tag and self.__next_f variable, strongly indicates that Next.js is used as the React framework.
Material UI (MUI): The <style> tags with data-emotion="mui-global" and data-emotion="mui" are clear indicators of Material UI being used as the UI component library. The data-s attribute in the style tags is also a characteristic of MUI's styling solution.
Tailwind CSS: The w-full mx-auto class on a <div> element in the body suggests the use of Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
Therefore, the application is most likely built using Next.js, Material UI (MUI), and Tailwind CSS.
